# Instruction to obtain data for recreating plots

The data was obtained from [grdc](https://grdc.bafg.de/products/basin_layers/major_rivers/) and the FAQ states that 
redistribution is not allowed, therefore, we recommend to manually build a suitable folder structure and to download 
the data yourself for a full reproduction of the plots. If this is beyond the scope needed, consider deleting 
the code involving the missing shape files.
