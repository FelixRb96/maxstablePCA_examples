# maxstablePCA_examples

Examples for the R package maxstablePCA on real datasets. The data is provided in notebooks, a  good installation tutorial 
on how to use jupyter notebooks with R can for example be found on  (TODO).

### Dataset examples

* airpollution: Dataset from the *texmex* R package about the extreme concetrations of gasses and micro dust  particles in a british city. 
This is a good introductory example because computation times are low and the dependence structure is relatively simple. 
* industry portfolios: A dataset of multivariate financial time series obtained from: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_30_ind_port.html which also holds the copyright. 
* dwd precipitation: An example of heavy rainfall in an area of eastern Germany with truly extreme weather events. Data is obtained from https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/opendata.html, a service provided by the DWD.
